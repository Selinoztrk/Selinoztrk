### 👋 Hi there, I'm Selin Öztürk!

I'm a self-taught Full-Stack Developer with a special passion for **front-end development**, especially **JavaScript** and **React**.  
I love crafting **modern, responsive, and interactive interfaces** that users enjoy.  

While front-end excites me the most, I'm also comfortable with **Python**, **Django**, and building **back-end systems**.  
I enjoy **building real-world applications**, experimenting with new technologies, and continuously learning through hands-on projects.
